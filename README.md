This is a third-person shooter defense game where players can effortlessly control aiming mechanics with just one finger. The main challenge for the player is to think and act quickly, and destroy the enemies without hitting civilians.

## How To Play

If you want to test the game, you can easily play it on the Simulator screen. If you want to play on the Game screen, you should set the screen resolution to any portrait resolution other than Free Aspect and turn on the "Window -> Analysis -> Input Debugger -> Options -> Simulate Touch Input From Mouse or Pen" option. When you play on the Simulator screen, you must turn off the "Simulate Touch Input From Mouse or Pen" option. This option is off by default.

Note: This project contains paid 3D assets. Before the project was made public, paid 3D assets were replaced with free assets. The project codes were developed by me and remain the same.
